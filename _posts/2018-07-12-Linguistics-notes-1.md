Consonants, Vowels, and IPA

**Phonetics vs Phonology,**

Phonetics studies physical and physiological aspects of sound where as Phonology studies sounds as an element of language ommiting any irrelevant to the linguistics.

**IPA - International Phonetic Alphabet**

IPA is an alphatic system for international phonetic notation, we use IPA because there are just simply so many different sounds we needed to invent a new alphabet to handle it. I'd like to put a picture here and try and explain it better, but really, it's just too much. The course provides an IPA chart [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8f/IPA_chart_%28C%292005.pdf) which really requires an understanding of what sound is what symbol which I don't have yet so [here's](http://www.ipachart.com/) an interactive version.

**Dinstinguishing consonats from vowels,** 

Sounds formed from a finite set with different 'inventories' of consonants and vowels are called features and accross the languages of the world there are inventory sizes of  Â± 20 to 200.  Vowels don't impede the airstream through your mouth like consonants do i.e. sticking your tounge to your teeth and in general every Syllable has a vowel but not neccesarilly a consonant. Consonants tend to be more important to a word meaning, in Semitic languages they tend to only write consonants and drop the vowels, vowels are more for say grammar and expressing finer structutre.

For example,

Cnsnnts tnd t b mr imprtnt t  wrd mnng, n smtc lnggs thy tnd t nly wrt cnsnnts nd drp th vwls, vwls r mr fr sy grmmr nd xprssng fnr strcttr.

Interstingly /m/ and /t/ are thought to be the only two consonants that all \(or almost all\) languages have, probably due to their ease of use and for vowels most languages tend to have /a/, /i/, and /u/.

There are **three dimesnions that cause consonants to differ** from eachother:

1\) The three **places of articulation** - **where** do we produce the sound?

* If you use your lips it's termed **Labial**.
* Or the roof of your mouth just behind your teeth where you put the tip of your tounge is the **Alveolar** after the Alveolar ridge.
* **Velar** is when you put the back of your tounge against the back-end of the roof of your mouth called the velum, other wise known as the soft palate.

2\) The **Manner of articulation** - what do we do to the **airstream**?

* **Splosive**/Stop is when we temporarily stop the airflow and release it again e.g /p/.
* **Fricative** - Closing your mouth mostly and letting some air slip through /th/.
* **Nasal** - When we let air through our nose while pronouncing a sound.
* **Sonorant** - unimpeded airflow, the air can get out more or less freely.

3\) **Voicing** - Using the **voice box** to produce a sound. With certain sounds the voice box will stay still and vibrate, this is voicing, un-voiced is when the voice box oves position.

**Some other concepts covered are:**

**Phonological activity** is feature change, e.g. sound A turning into sound B over time. We see this in OIr _Ocus_ to MIr _Agus._

**Symmetry of consonants** - " the even distribution of phonemes throughout the articulatory possibilities of a given language" \[[1](https://glossary.sil.org/term/phonological-symmetry)\]

**Path of acquisition** - how children learn or acquire language skills, in English children often learn /p/ and /t/ early on, showing they know voiceless, plosive, labial, and coronal.

**Speech error** is, for example when we accidently interchange sounds or features, such as saying Blake Fruid. We tend to swap voiced with unvoiced or nasal with non-nasal features, e.g. spaghetti to skabetti, a unvoiced /p/ becomes a voiced /k/ and vice versa  with /gh/ and /b/.
